			<h1>Research</h1>
			<p>I began researching biomechanics during my undergraduate education after becoming curious about the function of the unique walking rays of the Northern Searobin. With my advisor, Dr. Jason Ramsay, I explored searobin anatomy and function to reveal novel insights. Shortly after the project began, this video was produced by Westfield State University as an outreach campaign to help connect and inspire undergraduates to get involved with available research opportunities.</p>
      <p>As I begin my career here at Brown University, I will focus on the relationship between structure and function in muscle. I am interested in how muscle shape changes during contraction, and what implications that may have on force and power. Stay Tuned!</p>
