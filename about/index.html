			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am predominantly interested in how structure governs function in organisms. I focused on comparative anatomy during my undergraduate studies at Westfield State University, where I majored in Biology. Currently, my work in the<a href='https://www.brown.edu/research/labs/robertslab/' > Roberts Lab <a/> examines dynamic muscle shape change and its subsequent influence on contractile properties.</p>
